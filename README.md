## 📈 Key Findings

  - Wait times peak during summer and early winter months.
  - Average patient wait time is approximately 35 minutes.
  - Very weak correlation (-0.01) between wait time and satisfaction score.
  - Patterns suggest influence from seasonal illnesses and COVID-19 impacts.

## 📌 How to Reproduce
